[this is from Yotam, a Visual Studio user --tod]

Here is a zipped library BlinkM - it's a Visual Studio 2008 project,
compling and running.

The class that the end user should use is BlinkM. It provides simple
interface of SetColor(unsigned char R, unsigned char G, unsigned char B)
Other people might add extra functionality.

In addition please find two files of the minWG package, that I had to
change. I don't know why - it is supposed to be compiling and running on
windows... maybe the visual 2008 is different. Anyway the two files should
be planted instead of the regular files in minGW distribution.
